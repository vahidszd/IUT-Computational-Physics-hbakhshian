    "\n",
    "Modern science relies heavily on computational methods and data analysis, in addition to empirical evidence and scientific theory.\n",
    "PHYS 305 offers a comprehensive introduction to the essential skills needed for computation- and data-driven physics.\n",
    "This course covers a range of computational and numerical methods, including integration of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) and Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), equipping students with the tools necessary to solve complex problems in upper level physics.\n",
    "In addition, students will learn modern statistical methods and apply these techniques to physical research.\n",
    "The curriculum is designed to bridge theoretical concepts with practical applications.\n",
    "Through a combination of lectures, hands-on exercises, and projects, students will develop a robust understanding of the essential tools and techniques required for modern astrophysical research."

    "\n",
    "Prof. Chi-kwan \"CK\" Chan is a computational astrophysicist working with cutting edge technologies to advance both theoretical and observational research.\n",
    "He has developed new algorithms to study magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, used graphics processing units (GPUs) to accelerate general relativistic ray tracing, designed cloud computing infrastructures to handle big observational data, and applied machine learning algorithms to speed up and automate data processing.\n",
    "Some of CK's active projects include simulating and understanding accretion disks, capturing images of black holes, and visualizing astrophysical simulations in virtual reality.\n",
    "A true wildcat, CK received his bachelors and doctoral degrees from the University of Arizona."
