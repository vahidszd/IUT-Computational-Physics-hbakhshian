## Description of Course

Modern science relies heavily on computational methods and data analysis, in addition to empirical evidence and scientific theory.
PHYS 305 offers a comprehensive introduction to the essential skills needed for computation- and data-driven physics.
This course covers a range of computational and numerical methods, including integration of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) and Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), equipping students with the tools necessary to solve complex problems in upper level physics.
In addition, students will learn modern statistical methods and apply these techniques to physical research.
The curriculum is designed to bridge theoretical concepts with practical applications.
Through a combination of lectures, hands-on exercises, and projects, students will develop a robust understanding of the essential tools and techniques required for modern astrophysical research.

### Course Objectives

The goal of this course is to get students ready for modern computation- and data-driven physics.
In order to do so, we will expose the the students to multiple development tools and software development best practices.
We will introduce the basic of the `python` and `C` programming languages, and provide hands-on on data analysis and numerical problems.
We will also introduce basic data analysis methods and numerical analysis.
After taking this course, students should be able to solve simple physics problems numerically, create plots to visualize their results, and document their work and communicate with other physicists.
See "Expected Learning Outcomes" below.

## Assignments and Examinations

+++

### Schedule/Due Dates

The course includes 6 homework assignments and 2 group projects.
There are no quizzes or exams.

**Homework Assignments:**
Assignments will be given approximately every two weeks (see schedule below).
Students should begin working on them during the hands-on labs and submit them within one week of the assignment date.

**Group Projects:**
Projects will be completed in teams of approximately four students.
All project materials must be submitted within one week after the corresponding project presentations.

+++

### Writing Requirement

Although this is not a writing intensive course, good documentation is essential in communicating science and developing software.
Students are required to provide enough written explanations in their assignments.

+++

### Final Examination or Project

There will be no final exam.
Instead, students will need to finish two group projects.

The project presentations are scheduled in the weeks of March 2nd and April 27th.
All project materials must be submitted within one week after the corresponding project presentations.

+++

## Grading Scale and Policies

The course includes 6 homework assignments and 2 group projects.
Each homework assignment worth 10 points and each project worth 20 points, sum up to 100 points total.
Students are expected to submit their assignments and projects by the specified deadlines.

This course provides regular letter grades (A–E), which are based on a simple point system:
* A: 80–100  points
* B: 70–79.9 points
* C: 60–69.9 points
* D: 50–59.9 points
* E:  0–49.9 points

No scaling will be applied.

**Incomplete (I) or Withdrawal (W):**
Requests for incomplete (I) or withdrawal (W) must be made in accordance with University policy, which is available at https://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/courses-credit/grading/grading-system.

**Dispute of Grade Policy:**
If a student disagrees on his or her grade on a homework assignment or a project, the student must send the instructor a formal request through email to re-evaluate the grade within a week from the time that the student receives the grade.
Because no scaling will be applied in the final grade, the final grade cannot be re-evaluated.
The student is expected to know his or her own performance throughout the course.

## Code of Conduct

+++

### Classroom Behavior Policy

To foster a positive learning environment, students and instructors have a shared responsibility.
We want a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment where all of us feel comfortable with each other and where we can challenge ourselves to succeed.
To that end, our focus is on the tasks at hand and not on extraneous activities (e.g., texting, chatting, reading a newspaper, making phone calls, web surfing, etc.).

+++

### Threatening Behavior Policy

The UA Threatening Behavior by Students Policy prohibits threats of physical harm to any member of the University community, including to oneself. See http://policy.arizona.edu/education-and-student-affairs/threatening-behavior-students.

+++

### Accessibility and Accommodations

Recommended language is provided on the Disability Resource Center website: http://drc.arizona.edu/instructors/syllabus-statement.

+++

### Code of Academic Integrity

Students are encouraged to share intellectual views and discuss freely the principles and applications of course materials.
However, graded work/exercises must be the product of independent effort unless otherwise instructed.
Students are expected to adhere to the UA Code of Academic Integrity as described in the UA General Catalog. See:  https://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/student-rights-responsibilities/academic-integrity.

The University Libraries have some excellent tips for avoiding plagiarism, available at https://lib.arizona.edu/research/citing/plagiarism.

Selling class notes and/or other course materials to other students or to a third party for resale is not permitted without the instructor's express written consent.
Violations to this and other course rules are subject to the Code of Academic Integrity and may result in course sanctions.
Additionally, students who use D2L or UA e-mail to sell or buy these copyrighted materials are subject to Code of Conduct Violations for misuse of student e-mail addresses.
This conduct may also constitute copyright infringement.

+++

### Nondiscrimination and Anti-harassment Policy

The University of Arizona is committed to creating and maintaining an environment free of discrimination.
In support of this commitment, the University prohibits discrimination, including harassment and retaliation, based on a protected classification, including race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy), national origin, age, disability, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or genetic information.
For more information, including how to report a concern, please see https://policy.arizona.edu/employment-human-resources/nondiscrimination-and-anti-harassment-policy

Our classroom is a place where everyone is encouraged to express well-formed opinions and their reasons for those opinions.
We also want to create a tolerant and open environment where such opinions can be expressed without resorting to bullying or discrimination of others.

+++

### Usage of Generative AI

Homework and projects in this course are designed to help students apply class concepts, test their learning, and develop software development and science communication skills.
Generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and GitHub Co-Pilot, can be useful for brainstorming and debugging.
However, students must write their own code, take full responsibility for their work, and demonstrate a clear understanding of the concepts.

While AI tools can assist learning, they may produce inaccurate or biased outputs.
Students are responsible for verifying facts and critically assessing all submitted material.
Any use of generative AI must be acknowledged or cited (see [guidelines from UA library](https://libguides.library.arizona.edu/students-chatgpt/citing)).
Failure to disclose such use or to write original code will be considered a violation of academic integrity.

For questions, contact your instructor.
