    "my_project/\n",
    "├── pyproject.toml\n",
    "├── src/\n",
    "│   └── my_project/\n",
    "│       ├── __init__.py\n",
    "│       └── main.py\n",
    "└── tests/\n",
    "    └── test_main.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `pyproject.toml`: Contains packaging configuration.\n",
    "- `src/my_project/`: Source code.\n",
    "- `tests/`: Test files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following this structure makes your project easier to maintain and distribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing and Running Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing is essential for ensuring the correctness and stability of your code. One popular testing framework is `pytest`. A typical setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install `pytest`:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pytest\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Create a test file, for example `test_example.py`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def test_addition():\n",
    "    assert 1 + 1 == 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Run tests:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pytest\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Used with continuous integration tools, testing helps maintain a reliable codebase. By mastering virtual environments, packaging with `pyproject.toml`, adhering to PEP standards, and writing thorough tests, you will build robust and maintainable Python projects."

    "        self.color = color\n",
    "\n",
    "    def describe(self):\n",
    "        return f\"This shape is {self.color}.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "The `__init__` method is a special method that is called when an instance of the class is created. It initializes the instance with the given arguments. The `self` parameter refers to the instance being created.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `self` parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class. It is used to access variables and methods associated with the instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating an Instance\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create an instance of the class by calling the class name and passing the required arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_shape = Shape(\"red\")\n",
    "print(my_shape.describe())  # Output: This shape is red.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes can inherit from other classes. This allows you to create a hierarchy of classes that share a set of attributes and methods. Here is an example of a `Rectangle` class that inherits from `Shape`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Rectangle(Shape):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, color, width, height):\n",
    "        super().__init__(color)\n",
    "        self.width = width\n",
    "        self.height = height\n",
    "\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return self.width * self.height\n",
    "\n",
    "    def describe(self):\n",
    "        return f\"This rectangle is {self.color}, with an area of {self.area()} square units.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the Subclass\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create an instance of the subclass and use its methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_rectangle = Rectangle(\"blue\", 3, 4)\n",
    "print(my_rectangle.describe())  # Output: This rectangle is blue, with an area of 12 square units.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `__call__` Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__call__` method allows an instance of the class to be called as a function. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Circle(Shape):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, color, radius):\n",
    "        super().__init__(color)\n",
    "        self.radius = radius\n",
    "\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __call__(self):\n",
    "        return f\"This circle is {self.color}, with an area of {self.area()} square units.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the `__call__` Method\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create an instance of the class and call it as a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_circle = Circle(\"green\", 5)\n",
    "print(my_circle())  # Output: This circle is green, with an area of 78.5 square units.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
