    "\n",
    "In scientific computing and machine learning, interpolation and extrapolation are fundamental tools for estimating function values at new data points based on known information.\n",
    "* In machine learning, all standard supervised learning tasks can be viewed as interpolation problems in high-dimensional space. Here, models predict outputs **within the range** of their training data.\n",
    "* However, when attempting to make predictions outside this range, we face significant challenges in making reliable extrapolations.\n",
    "  Extrapolation is a particularly challenging task because models typically lack information  beyond their training data."

    "Interpolation plays a crucial role in scientific computing and machine learning by estimating function values at new data points based on known information.\n",

    "* This can be mitigated by using rational functions, which offer more stable estimates and are better suited to handle asymptotic behavior.\n",
    "* Spline interpolation, especially cubic splines, is valued for its smoothness and continuity up to the second derivative. This makes it effective for applications requiring a smooth fit."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we studied interpolation techniques, focusing on polynomial interpolation.\n",
    "We derive and implemented Neville's Algorithm, a recursive method that constructs an interpolating polynomial while also providing an internal error estimate.\n",
    "This technique offers insight into the stability of interpolation at specific points, making it particularly useful for small datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, polynomial interpolation is not always the best choice, especially for large datasets or unevenly spaced data.\n",
    "Alternative techniques such as cubic splines, rational function interpolation, and multidimensional interpolation provide more robust and flexible approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "For further study, we recommend exploring:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cubic Spline Interpolation: A method that ensures smoothness across intervals, mitigating oscillatory behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Rational Function Interpolation: A technique that models asymptotic behavior effectively, reducing instability.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Interpolating Polynomial Coefficients: A computationally efficient way to determine polynomial coefficients directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multidimensional Interpolation: Methods for interpolating data in multiple dimensions, applicable to spatial data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Laplace Interpolation: A specialized approach for interpolating harmonic functions using Laplaceâ€™s equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these advanced methods can help address the challenges posed by polynomial interpolation and extend its practical applications to more complex interpolation problems."
